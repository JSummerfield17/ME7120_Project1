During the spring season, Bob helped Farmer Pickles in the fields with Bob's team.

The backhoe named "Scoop" was happy to help with digging a hole to make a fence.

After the task, they took a break.6

Scoop was the first to speak.

Scoop said "What a beautiful spring day it is!"

Bob said the second thing!

Bob stated that he wanted to play a game.
